[NOTE]
.Note
====
Using the headset ID to alter application behavior is discouraged, as it
interferes with compatibility with current and future headsets.
The OpenXR specification is designed with the goal of avoiding the need for
explicit per-device logic.
If the use of this extension is required, it is encouraged to let the OpenXR
working group know about the use case, through a communication channel like
email or GitHub.
While this usage is discouraged, applications that need this functionality
are encouraged to use this extension instead of the pname:systemName field
in slink:XrSystemProperties.
Game engines and similar middleware should: not enable this extension by
default.
This extension will be deprecated and no longer exposed once the remaining
use cases are resolved in a more portable way.

The slink:XrSystemHeadsetIdPropertiesMETA structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemHeadsetIdPropertiesMETA.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:id is the slink:XrUuidEXT corresponding to the headset model.
****

An application can: get a corresponding headset UUID of the headset model by
chaining an slink:XrSystemHeadsetIdPropertiesMETA structure to the
slink:XrSystemProperties when calling flink:xrGetSystemProperties.

The UUID returned in the slink:XrSystemHeadsetIdPropertiesMETA struct is an
opaque UUID that identifies a runtime / headset model combo.

The runtime should: always return the same UUID for a given headset model
for the entire lifetime of that product.

The runtime may: report a different UUID to some applications for
compatibility purposes.

This is in contrast to the pname:systemName field in
slink:XrSystemProperties which is not required to be consistent across
product renames.

This is intended to be a temporary feature that will be deprecated along
with its extension as soon as motivating use cases are resolved in a better
way.
See the disclaimer at the start of the `<<XR_META_headset_id>>` extension
documentation for more details.
