*Overview*

Local dimming allows to adjust backlight intensity of dark areas on the
screen in order to increase content dynamic range.
Local dimming feature is not intended for optical see-through HMDs.

An application can: request the local dimming mode on a frame basis by
chaining an slink:XrLocalDimmingFrameEndInfoMETA structure to the
slink:XrFrameEndInfo.

* Using XrFrameEndInfoLocalDimmingFB is considered as a hint and will not
  trigger flink:xrEndFrame errors whether or not the requested dimming mode
  is fulfilled by the runtime.
* The runtime will have full control of the local dimming mode and may:
  disregard app requests.
  For example, the runtime may: allow only one primary client to control the
  local dimming mode.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:localDimmingMode is the local dimming mode for current submitted
  frame.
****

The slink:XrLocalDimmingFrameEndInfoMETA is a structure that an application
can: chain in slink:XrFrameEndInfo in order to request a local dimming mode.
