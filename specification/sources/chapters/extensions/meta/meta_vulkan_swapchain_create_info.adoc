*Overview*

Using this extension, a Vulkan-based application can: pass through
additional ename:VkImageCreateFlags or ename:VkImageUsageFlags by chaining
an slink:XrVulkanSwapchainCreateInfoMETA structure to the
slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo when calling flink:xrCreateSwapchain.

The application is still encouraged to use the common bits like
ename:XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT defined in
elink:XrSwapchainUsageFlags.
However, the application may: present both
ename:XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT in elink:XrSwapchainUsageFlags and
ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT in ename:VkImageUsageFlags at the same
time.

The application must: enable the corresponding Vulkan extensions before
requesting additional Vulkan flags.
For example, ename:VK_EXT_fragment_density_map device extension must: be
enabled if an application requests ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SUBSAMPLED_BIT_EXT
bit.
Otherwise, it may: cause undefined behavior, including an application crash.

Runtimes that implement this extension must: support the
`<<XR_KHR_vulkan_enable>>` or the `<<XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2>>` extension.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:additionalCreateFlags is a bitmask of ename:VkImageCreateFlags
  describing additional parameters of an image.
* pname:additionalUsageFlags is a bitmask of ename:VkImageUsageFlags
  describing additional parameters of an image.
****

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED if any bit of
either pname:additionalCreateFlags or pname:additionalUsageFlags is not
supported.
