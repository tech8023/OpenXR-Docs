*Overview*

This extension provides access to Magic Leap specific extensions to frame
settings like focus distance, vignette, and protection.

*New Flag Types*

[open,refpage='XrFrameEndInfoFlagsML',type='flags',desc='XrFrameEndInfoFlagsML',xrefs='xrEndFrame XrFrameEndInfoML XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML']
--
The slink:XrFrameEndInfoML::pname:flags member is of the following type, and
contains a bitwise-OR of zero or more of the bits defined in
elink:XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML.

[open,refpage='XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML',type='enums',desc='XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML',xrefs='xrEndFrame XrFrameEndInfoML XrFrameEndInfoFlagsML']
--
Valid bits for elink:XrFrameEndInfoFlagsML are defined by
elink:XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML, which is specified as:

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML.txt[]

The flag bits have the following meanings:

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_FRAME_END_INFO_ML

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrFrameEndInfoML',type='structs',desc='Per frame configuration parameters.',xrefs='XrFrameEndInfoFlagBitsML']
--

The slink:XrFrameEndInfoML structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrFrameEndInfoML.txt[]


.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:focusDistance is the distance, in meters, to defined focus point for
  the client content.
  The focus distance is interpreted as the positive distance to the
  client-determined object of interest (relative to the forward vector of
  the Lightwear).
* pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:XrFrameEndInfoFlagsML
