*Overview*

On some platforms, before loading can occur the loader must be initialized
with platform-specific parameters.
Unlike other extensions, the presence of this extension is signaled by a
successful call to flink:xrGetInstanceProcAddr to retrieve the function
pointer for flink:xrInitializeLoaderKHR using a null instance handle.
If this extension is supported, its use may be required on some platforms
and the use of the flink:xrInitializeLoaderKHR function must precede other
OpenXR calls except flink:xrGetInstanceProcAddr.
This function exists as part of the loader library that the application is
using.

--
The slink:XrLoaderInitInfoBaseHeaderKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrLoaderInitInfoBaseHeaderKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
  This base structure itself has no associated elink:XrStructureType value.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.

*New Functions*
[open,refpage='xrInitializeLoaderKHR',desc='Initializes loader',type='protos']
--
To initialize an OpenXR loader with platform or implementation-specific
parameters, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrInitializeLoaderKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:loaderInitInfo is a pointer to an
  slink:XrLoaderInitInfoBaseHeaderKHR structure, which is a polymorphic type
  defined by other platform- or implementation-specific extensions.
