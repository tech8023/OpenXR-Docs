*Overview*

This extension adds an optional structure that can be included on the
slink:XrInteractionProfileSuggestedBinding::pname:next chain passed to
flink:xrSuggestInteractionProfileBindings to specify additional information
to modify default binding behavior.

This extension does not define any actual modification structs, but includes
the list of modifications and the slink:XrBindingModificationBaseHeaderKHR
structure to allow other extensions to provide specific modifications.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_BINDING_MODIFICATIONS_KHR

*New Enums*

The slink:XrBindingModificationsKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrBindingModificationsKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:bindingModificationCount is the number of binding modifications in
  the array pointed to by pname:bindingModifications.
* pname:bindingModifications is a pointer to an array of pointers to binding
  modification structures based on slink:XrBindingModificationBaseHeaderKHR,
  that define all of the application's suggested binding modifications for
  the specified interaction profile.

The slink:XrBindingModificationBaseHeaderKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrBindingModificationBaseHeaderKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
  This base structure itself has no associated elink:XrStructureType value.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or in this extension.

The slink:XrBindingModificationBaseHeaderKHR is a base structure is
overridden by stext:XrBindingModification* child structures.
