*Overview*

A common activity in XR is to view an image stream.
Image streams are often the result of camera previews or decoded video
streams.
On Android, the basic primitive representing the producer end of an image
queue is the class `android.view.Surface`.
This extension provides a special swapchain that uses an
`android.view.Surface` as its producer end.

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreateSwapchainAndroidSurfaceKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession handle previously created with
  flink:xrCreateSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to an slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo structure.
* pname:swapchain is a pointer to a handle in which the created
  slink:XrSwapchain is returned.
* pname:surface is a pointer to a `jobject` where the created Android
  Surface is returned.
****

flink:xrCreateSwapchainAndroidSurfaceKHR creates an slink:XrSwapchain object
returned in pname:swapchain and an Android Surface `jobject` returned in
pname:surface.
The `jobject` must: be valid to be passed back to Java code using JNI and
must: be valid to be used with ordinary Android APIs for submitting images
to Surfaces.
The returned slink:XrSwapchain must: be valid to be referenced in
slink:XrSwapchainSubImage structures to show content on the screen.
The width and height passed in slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo may: not be
persistent throughout the life cycle of the created swapchain, since on
Android, the size of the images is controlled by the producer and possibly
changes at any time.

The only function that is allowed to be called on the slink:XrSwapchain
returned from this function is flink:xrDestroySwapchain.
For example, calling any of the functions flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages,
flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage, flink:xrWaitSwapchainImage or
flink:xrReleaseSwapchainImage is invalid.

When the application receives the slink:XrEventDataSessionStateChanged event
with the ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_STOPPING state, it must: ensure that no
threads are writing to any of the Android surfaces created with this
extension before calling flink:xrEndSession.
The effect of writing frames to the Surface when the session is in states
other than ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_VISIBLE or ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_FOCUSED
is undefined.

flink:xrCreateSwapchainAndroidSurfaceKHR must: return the same set of error
codes as flink:xrCreateSwapchain under the same circumstances, plus
ename:XR_ERROR_FUNCTION_UNSUPPORTED in case the function is not supported.

.Valid Usage of slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo members
****
* The slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo::pname:format, +
  slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo::pname:sampleCount, +
  slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo::pname:faceCount, +
  slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo::pname:arraySize and +
  slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo::pname:mipCount +
  members of the structure passed as the pname:info parameter must: be zero.
