*Overview*

This extension adds an additional layer type where the XR runtime must map
an equirectangular coded image stemming from a swapchain onto the inside of
a sphere.

The equirect layer type provides most of the same benefits as a cubemap, but
from an equirect 2D image source.
This image source is appealing mostly because equirect environment maps are
very common, and the highest quality you can get from them is by sampling
them directly in the compositor.

This is not a projection type of layer but rather an object-in-world type of
layer, similar to slink:XrCompositionLayerQuad.
Only the interior of the sphere surface must: be visible; the exterior of
the sphere is not visible and must: not be drawn by the runtime.

*New Object Types*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

The slink:XrCompositionLayerEquirectKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrCompositionLayerEquirectKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:layerFlags specifies options for the layer.
* pname:space is the slink:XrSpace in which the pname:pose of the equirect
  layer is evaluated over time.
* pname:eye is the eye represented by this layer.
* pname:subImage identifies the image slink:XrSwapchainSubImage to use.
  The swapchain must: have been created with a pname:faceCount of 1.
* pname:pose is an slink:XrPosef defining the position and orientation of
the center point of the sphere onto which the equirect image data is mapped,
relative to the reference frame of the pname:space.
* pname:radius is the non-negative radius of the sphere onto which the
  equirect image data is mapped.
  Values of zero or floating point positive infinity are treated as an
  infinite sphere.
* pname:scale is an slink:XrVector2f indicating a scale of the texture
  coordinates after the mapping to 2D.
* pname:bias is an slink:XrVector2f indicating a bias of the texture
  coordinates after the mapping to 2D.

slink:XrCompositionLayerEquirectKHR contains the information needed to
render an equirectangular image onto a sphere when calling flink:xrEndFrame.
slink:XrCompositionLayerEquirectKHR is an alias type for the base struct
slink:XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader used in slink:XrFrameEndInfo.

   such extension layer types.
* Revision 2, 2017-12-07 (Paul Pedriana)
** Updated to use transform components instead of transform matrices.
* Revision 3, 2019-01-24 (Martin Renschler)
** Reformatted, spec language changes, eye parameter description update
