*Overview*

This extension enables multiple spatial entities at a time to be persisted
across sessions.
If the ename:XR_SPACE_COMPONENT_TYPE_STORABLE_FB component has been enabled
on the spatial entity, application developers may: save and erase
slink:XrSpace entities.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_LIST_SAVE_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SPACE_LIST_SAVE_COMPLETE_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The slink:XrSpaceListSaveInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSpaceListSaveInfoFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:spaceCount is the number of spatial entities to save.
* pname:spaces is a list of slink:XrSpace handles for the entities to be
  saved.
* pname:location is the storage location.
****

The slink:XrSpaceListSaveInfoFB structure contains information used to save
multiple spatial entities.

--
The slink:XrEventDataSpaceListSaveCompleteFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataSpaceListSaveCompleteFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:requestId is the ID of the asynchronous request to save an entity.
* pname:result is an elink:XrResult that describes whether the request
  succeeded or if an error occurred.
****

This completion event indicates that a request to save a list of
slink:XrSpace objects has completed.
The application can: use pname:result to check if the request was successful
or if an error occurred.

.Result Codes

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrSaveSpaceListFB',desc='Saves a list of spatial entities to persistent storage',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrSaveSpaceListFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrSaveSpaceListFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info contains the parameters for the save operation.
* pname:requestId is an output parameter, and the variable it points to will
  be populated with the ID of this asynchronous request.
****

The flink:xrSaveSpaceListFB function persists the specified spatial entities
at the specified storage location.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
slink:XrSpaceSaveInfoFB::pname:location is invalid.
This operation is asynchronous and the runtime must: post an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceListSaveCompleteFB event when the operation completes
successfully or encounters an error.
