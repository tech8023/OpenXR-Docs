*Overview*

This extension enables spatial entities to be shared between users.
If the ename:XR_SPACE_COMPONENT_TYPE_SHARABLE_FB component has been enabled
on the spatial entity, application developers may: share slink:XrSpace
entities between users.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_SHARE_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SPACE_SHARE_COMPLETE_FB

elink:XrResult enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_MAPPING_INSUFFICIENT_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_LOCALIZATION_FAILED_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_NETWORK_TIMEOUT_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_NETWORK_REQUEST_FAILED_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_CLOUD_STORAGE_DISABLED_FB

*New Enums*

*New Base Types*

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrSpaceShareInfoFB',type='structs',desc='Describes a request to share some number of spatial entities',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSpaceShareInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSpaceShareInfoFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
  pname:spaceCount is the number of elements in the pname:spaces list.
  pname:spaces is a list containing all spatial entities to be shared.
  pname:userCount is the number of elements in the pname:users list.
  pname:users is a list of the users with which the pname:spaces will: be
  shared.
****

The slink:XrSpaceShareInfoFB structure describes a request to share one or
more spatial entities with one or more users.

[open,refpage='XrEventDataSpaceShareCompleteFB',type='structs',desc='Completion of request to share one or more spatial entities',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrEventDataSpaceShareCompleteFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataSpaceShareCompleteFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:requestId is the ID of the asynchronous request used to share the
  spatial entities.
* pname:result is an elink:XrResult that describes whether the request
  succeeded or if an error occurred.
****

It indicates that the request to share one or more spatial entities has
completed.
The application can: use pname:result to check if the request was successful
or if an error occurred.

.Result Codes
****

<<fundamentals-successcodes,Success>>::

* ename:XR_SUCCESS

<<fundamentals-errorcodes,Failure>>::

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrShareSpacesFB',desc='Shares spatial entities with specified users',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrShareSpacesFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrShareSpacesFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to an slink:XrSpaceShareInfoFB structure
  containing information about which spatial entities to share with which
  users.
* pname:requestId is the output parameter that points to the ID of this
  asynchronous request.
****

This operation is asynchronous and the runtime must: post an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceShareCompleteFB event when the operation completes
successfully or encounters an error.
The pname:requestId can: be used to later refer to the request, such as
identifying which request has completed when an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceShareCompleteFB is posted to the event queue.
