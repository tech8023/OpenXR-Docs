*Overview*

This extension defines a new interaction profile for the Meta Quest Touch
Pro Controller.

Meta Quest Touch Pro Controller Profile Path:

* pathname:/interaction_profiles/facebook/touch_controller_pro

Valid for user paths:

* pathname:/user/hand/left
* pathname:/user/hand/right

This interaction profile provides inputs and outputs that are a superset of
those available in the existing "Oculus Touch Controller" interaction
profile:

* pathname:/interaction_profiles/oculus/touch_controller

Supported component paths (Note that the paths which are marked as 'new' are
enabled by Meta Quest Touch Pro Controller profile exclusively):

* On pathname:/user/hand/left only:
** subpathname:/input/x/click
** subpathname:/input/x/touch
** subpathname:/input/y/click
** subpathname:/input/y/touch
** subpathname:/input/menu/click

* On pathname:/user/hand/right only:
** subpathname:/input/a/click
** subpathname:/input/a/touch
** subpathname:/input/b/click
** subpathname:/input/b/touch
** subpathname:/input/system/click (may: not be available for application
   use)

* On both:
** subpathname:/input/squeeze/value
** subpathname:/input/trigger/value
** subpathname:/input/trigger/touch
** subpathname:/input/thumbstick
** subpathname:/input/thumbstick/x
** subpathname:/input/thumbstick/y
** subpathname:/input/thumbstick/click
** subpathname:/input/thumbstick/touch
** subpathname:/input/thumbrest/touch
** subpathname:/input/grip/pose
** subpathname:/input/aim/pose
** subpathname:/output/haptic

** subpathname:/input/thumbrest/force (new)
** subpathname:/input/stylus_fb/force (new)
** subpathname:/input/trigger/curl_fb (new)
** subpathname:/input/trigger/slide_fb (new)
** subpathname:/input/trigger/proximity_fb (new)
** subpathname:/input/thumb_fb/proximity_fb (new)
** subpathname:/output/haptic_trigger_fb (new)
** subpathname:/output/haptic_thumb_fb (new)

*New Identifiers*
****
* *stylus_fb*: Meta Quest Touch Pro Controller adds an optional stylus tip
  that can be interchanged with the lanyard.
  This tip can detect various pressure levels and could be used for writing
  or drawing.
* *thumb_fb*: Meta Quest Touch Pro Controller adds a 1-dimensional analog
  input value for the thumb.
  This is similar to other triggers on the controller like the fore trigger
  for the index finger and grip trigger for the middle finger.
****

*Input Path Descriptions*
****
* */input/thumbrest/force* : Allow developers to access the normalized 1D
  force value associated with the thumb ranging from 0-6 Newtons: 0 = not
  pressed, 1 = fully pressed
* */input/stylus_fb/force* : Allow developers to access the normalized 1D
  force value associated with the stylus ranging from ~0-2 Newtons: 0 = not
  pressed, 1 = fully pressed
* */input/trigger/curl_fb* : This represents how pointed or curled the
  user's finger is on the trigger: 0 = fully pointed, 1 = finger flat on
  surface
* */input/trigger/slide_fb*: This represents how far the user is sliding
  their index finger along the surface of the trigger: 0 = finger flat on
  the surface, 1 = finger fully drawn back
* */input/trigger/proximity_fb* : Bit indicating whether the user's index
  finger is near the trigger
* */input/thumb_fb/proximity_fb* : Bit indicating the user's thumb is near
  the touchpad
****

*Output Path Descriptions*
****
In addition to the VCM motor, Meta Quest Touch Pro Controller has two
localized LRA haptics elements located in the fore trigger and under the
touchpad.

* */output/haptic_trigger_fb* represents the path to the haptic element in
  the trigger
* */output/haptic_thumb_fb* represents the path to the haptic element under
  the touchpad
****

*Version History*

* Revision 1, 2022-06-29 (Aanchal Dalmia)
** Initial extension proposal
