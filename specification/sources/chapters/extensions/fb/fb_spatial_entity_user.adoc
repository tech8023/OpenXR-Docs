*Overview*

This extension enables creation and management of user objects which can: be
used by the application to reference a user other than the current user.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

[open,refpage='XrSpaceUserFB',type='handles',desc='Represents a user with which spaces can be shared']
--
include::{generated}/api/handles/XrSpaceUserFB.txt[]

Represents a user with which the application can: interact using various
extensions including <<XR_FB_spatial_entity_sharing>>.
See flink:xrCreateSpaceUserFB for how to declare a user.
--

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_USER_CREATE_INFO_FB

*New Enums*

*New Base Types*

[open,refpage='XrSpaceUserIdFB',desc='User ID with which spaces can be shared',type='basetypes']
--
The basetype:XrSpaceUserIdFB type is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/basetypes/XrSpaceUserIdFB.txt[]

An implementation-defined ID of the underlying user.
--

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrSpaceUserCreateInfoFB',type='structs',desc='Describes a user',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSpaceUserCreateInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSpaceUserCreateInfoFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:userId is the user ID with which the application can reference.
****

The slink:XrSpaceUserCreateInfoFB structure describes a user with which the
application can: interact.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrCreateSpaceUserFB',desc='Creates a user other than the current user',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrCreateSpaceUserFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreateSpaceUserFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to an slink:XrSpaceUserCreateInfoFB structure
  containing information to create the user handle.
* pname:user is the output parameter that points to the handle of the user
  being created.
****

The application can: use this function to create a user handle with which it
can: then interact, such as sharing slink:XrSpace objects.

[open,refpage='xrGetSpaceUserIdFB',desc='Gets the user ID for a given user handle',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrGetSpaceUserIdFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetSpaceUserIdFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:user is a handle to an slink:XrSpaceUserFB.
* pname:userId is the output parameter that points to the user ID of the
  user.
****

The application can: use this function to retrieve the user ID of a given
user handle.

[open,refpage='xrDestroySpaceUserFB',desc='Destroys a user handle',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrDestroySpaceUserFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrDestroySpaceUserFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:user is a handle to the user object to be destroyed.
****

The application should: use this function to release resources tied to a
given slink:XrSpaceUserFB once the application no longer needs to reference
the user.
