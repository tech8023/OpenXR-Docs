*Overview*

This extension allows an application to request that the system begin
capturing information about what is in the environment around the user.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SCENE_CAPTURE_REQUEST_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SCENE_CAPTURE_COMPLETE_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrSceneCaptureRequestInfoFB',type='structs',desc='Describes how a scene capture should be conducted by the system',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSceneCaptureRequestInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSceneCaptureRequestInfoFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:requestByteCount is byte length of the pname:request parameter.
* pname:request is a string which the application can: use to specify which
  type of scene capture should be initiated by the runtime.
  The contents of buffer pointed to by the pname:request parameter is
  runtime-specific.
****

The slink:XrSceneCaptureRequestInfoFB structure is used by an application to
instruct the system what to look for during a scene capture.
If the pname:request parameter is code:NULL, then the runtime must: conduct
a default scene capture.

The slink:XrEventDataSceneCaptureCompleteFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataSceneCaptureCompleteFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:requestId is the ID of the asynchronous query request.
* pname:result is an elink:XrResult that indicates if the request succeeded
  or if an error occurred.

The slink:XrEventDataSceneCaptureCompleteFB structure is used by an
application to instruct the system what to look for during a scene capture.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrRequestSceneCaptureFB',desc='Begins a scene capture using the specified parameters',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrRequestSceneCaptureFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrRequestSceneCaptureFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is an slink:XrSceneCaptureRequestInfoFB which specifies how the
  scene capture should occur.
* pname:requestId is the output parameter that points to the ID of this
  asynchronous request.
****

The flink:xrRequestSceneCaptureFB function is used by an application to
begin capturing the scene around the user.
This is an asynchronous operation.
