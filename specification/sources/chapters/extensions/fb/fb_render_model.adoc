*Overview*

This extension allows applications to request GLTF models for certain
connected devices supported by the runtime.
Paths that correspond to these devices will be provided through the
extension and can be used to get information about the models as well as
loading them.

*New Flag Types*

Render Model Support Levels: An application should: request a model of a
certain complexity via the slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB on the
structure chain of slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB passed into
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.
The flags on the slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB are an
acknowledgement of the application's ability to render such a model.
Multiple values of elink:XrRenderModelFlagBitsFB can be set on this variable
to indicate acceptance of different support levels.
The flags parameter on the slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB will indicate
what capabilities the model in the runtime actually requires.
It will be set to a single value of elink:XrRenderModelFlagBitsFB.
--

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SYSTEM_RENDER_MODEL_PROPERTIES_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_PATH_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_PROPERTIES_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_BUFFER_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_LOAD_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_MAX_RENDER_MODEL_NAME_SIZE_FB

*New Defines*

[open,refpage='XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB',type='defines',desc='The value representing an invalid model key',xrefs='XrRenderModelKeyFB XrRenderModelPropertiesFB']
--
include::{generated}/api/defines/XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB.txt[]

dlink:XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB defines an invalid model key atom.
--

*New Base Types*

[open,refpage='XrRenderModelKeyFB',desc='Model key',type='basetypes',xrefs='XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB']
--
include::{generated}/api/basetypes/XrRenderModelKeyFB.txt[]

The unique model key used to retrieve the data for the render model that is
valid across multiple instances and installs.
The application can use this key along with the model version to update its
cached or saved version of the model.
--

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrSystemRenderModelPropertiesFB',type='structs',desc='A render model system property',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSystemRenderModelPropertiesFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemRenderModelPropertiesFB.txt[]

It describes a render model system property.

* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.

connected device that the path represents using
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.

* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB is a structure in this structure

slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB contains information about the render model
for a device.
slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB must: be provided when calling
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.
The basetype:XrRenderModelKeyFB included in the properties is a unique key
for each render model that is valid across multiple instances and installs.

If the application decides to cache or save the render model in any way,
pname:modelVersion can be used to determine if the render model has changed.
The application should: then update its cached or saved version.

slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB contains information about the
render capabilities requested for a model.
slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB must: be set in the structure chain
of the pname:next pointer on the slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB passed into
the flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB call.
The pname:flags on slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB represent an
acknowledgement of being able to handle the individual model capability
levels.
If no slink:XrRenderModelCapabilitiesRequestFB is on the structure chain
then the runtime should: treat it as if a value of
ename:XR_RENDER_MODEL_SUPPORTS_GLTF_2_0_SUBSET_1_BIT_FB was set.
If the runtime does not have a model available that matches any of the
supports flags set, then it must: return a
ename:XR_RENDER_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE_FB result.

*New Functions*

* pname:pathCapacityInput is the capacity of the pname:paths, or 0 to
  retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:pathCountOutput is a pointer to the count of code:float pname:paths

* pname:paths is a pointer to an application-allocated array that will be
  filled with slink:XrRenderModelPathInfoFB values that are supported by the
  runtime, but can: be code:NULL if pname:pathCapacityInput is `0`
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:paths size.
****

The application must: call flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB to enumerate
the valid render model paths that are supported by the runtime before
calling flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.
The paths returned may: be used later in flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.txt[]

[open,refpage='xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB',desc='Get information for a render model',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the specified slink:XrSession.
* pname:path is the path of the render model to get the properties for.
* pname:properties is a pointer to the slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB to
  write the render model information to.
****

flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB is used for getting information for a
render model using a path retrieved from
flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.
The information returned will be for the connected device that corresponds
to the path given.
For example, using pathname:/model_fb/controller/left will return
information for the left controller that is currently connected and will
change if a different device that also represents a left controller is
connected.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_CALL_ORDER_INVALID if
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB is called with render model paths before
calling flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_PATH_INVALID if a path not given by
flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB is used.

If flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB returns a success code of
ename:XR_RENDER_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE_FB and has a pname:modelKey of
dlink:XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB, this indicates that the model for the
device is unavailable.
The application may: keep calling flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB because
the model may: become available later when a device is connected.

[open,refpage='xrLoadRenderModelFB',desc='Load binary data for a render model',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrLoadRenderModelFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the specified slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to the slink:XrRenderModelLoadInfoFB structure.
* pname:buffer is a pointer to the slink:XrRenderModelBufferFB structure to
  write the binary data into.
****

flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB is used to load the GLTF model data using a valid
pname:modelKey.
flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB loads the model as a byte buffer containing the
GLTF in the binary format (GLB).
The GLB data must: conform to the glTF 2.0 format defined at {uri-fb-gltf2}
The GLB may: contain texture data in a format that requires the use of the
`KHR_texture_basisu` GLTF extension defined at {uri-fb-gltf2-basisu}.
Therefore, the application should: ensure it can handle this extension.

If the device for the requested model is disconnected or does not match the
pname:modelKey provided, flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB must: return
ename:XR_RENDER_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE_FB as well as a pname:bufferCountOutput
value of 0 indicating that the model was not available.

The flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB function may: be slow, therefore applications
should: call it from a non-time sensitive thread.
