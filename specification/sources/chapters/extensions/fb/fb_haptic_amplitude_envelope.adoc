==== Overview

This extension enables applications to trigger haptic effect using an
Amplitude Envelope buffer.

*Trigger haptics*

[open,refpage='XrHapticAmplitudeEnvelopeVibrationFB',type='structs',desc='Haptic Effect Description',xrefs='']
--
An application can trigger an amplitude envelope haptic effect by creating a
slink:XrHapticAmplitudeEnvelopeVibrationFB structure and calling
flink:xrApplyHapticFeedback.

The slink:XrHapticAmplitudeEnvelopeVibrationFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrHapticAmplitudeEnvelopeVibrationFB.txt[]

This structure describes an amplitude envelope haptic effect.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:duration is the duration of the haptic effect in nanoseconds.
  See <<duration>> for more details.
* pname:amplitudeCount is the number of samples in the buffer.
* pname:amplitudes is the pointer to a float array that contains the
  samples.
****

The runtime should: resample the provided samples in the pname:amplitudes,
and maintain an internal buffer which should: be of
dlink:XR_MAX_HAPTIC_AMPLITUDE_ENVELOPE_SAMPLES_FB length.
The resampling should: happen based on the pname:duration,
pname:amplitudeCount, and the device's sample rate.
