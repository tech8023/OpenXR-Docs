*Overview*

This extension enables applications to use spatial entities to specify
world-locked frames of reference.
It enables applications to persist the real world location of content over
time and contains definitions for the Entity-Component System.
All Facebook spatial entity and scene extensions are dependent on this one.

We use OpenXR slink:XrSpace handles to give applications access to spatial
entities such as Spatial Anchors.
In other words, any operation which involves spatial entities uses
slink:XrSpace handles to identify the affected spatial entities.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

This extension allows:

* An application to create a Spatial Anchor (a type of spatial entity).
* An application to enumerate supported components for a given spatial
  entity.
* An application to enable or disable a component for a given spatial
  entity.
* An application to get the status of a component for a given spatial
  entity.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SYSTEM_SPATIAL_ENTITY_PROPERTIES_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_SPATIAL_ANCHOR_CREATE_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_COMPONENT_STATUS_SET_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_COMPONENT_STATUS_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SPATIAL_ANCHOR_CREATE_COMPLETE_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SPACE_SET_STATUS_COMPLETE_FB

elink:XrResult enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_COMPONENT_NOT_SUPPORTED_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_COMPONENT_NOT_ENABLED_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_COMPONENT_STATUS_PENDING_FB
* ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_COMPONENT_STATUS_ALREADY_SET_FB

*New Enums*

[open,refpage='XrSpaceComponentTypeFB',desc='Component type',type='enums']
--

[open,refpage='XrAsyncRequestIdFB',desc='Asynchronous request ID',type='basetypes']
--
The basetype:XrAsyncRequestIdFB base type is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/basetypes/XrAsyncRequestIdFB.txt[]

Represents a request to the spatial entity system.
Several functions in this and other extensions will populate an output
variable of this type so that an application can: use it when referring to a
specific request.
--

*New Structures*

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:supportsSpatialEntity is a boolean value that determines if spatial
  entities are supported by the system.
****

An application can: inspect whether the system is capable of spatial entity
operations by extending the slink:XrSystemProperties with
slink:XrSystemSpatialEntityPropertiesFB structure when calling
flink:xrGetSystemProperties.

If a runtime returns ename:XR_FALSE for pname:supportsSpatialEntity, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrGetSpaceUuidFB.

--
The flink:xrCreateSpatialAnchorFB function is defined as:

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to an slink:XrSpatialAnchorCreateInfoFB structure
  containing information about how to create the anchor.
* pname:requestId is the output parameter that points to the ID of this
  asynchronous request.
****

Creates a Spatial Anchor using the specified tracking origin and pose
relative to the specified tracking origin.
The anchor will be locatable at the time of creation, and the 6 DOF pose
relative to the tracking origin can: be queried using the
flink:xrLocateSpace method.
This operation is asynchronous and the runtime must: post an
slink:XrEventDataSpatialAnchorCreateCompleteFB event when the operation
completes successfully or encounters an error.
The pname:requestId can: be used to later refer to the request, such as
identifying which request has completed when an
slink:XrEventDataSpatialAnchorCreateCompleteFB is posted to the event queue.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/xrCreateSpatialAnchorFB.txt[]

[open,refpage='xrGetSpaceUuidFB',desc='Gets an entity's unique identifier',type='protos',xrefs='']
--

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetSpaceUuidFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:space is the slink:XrSpace handle of a spatial entity.
* pname:uuid is an output parameter pointing to the entity's UUID.
****

Gets the UUID for a spatial entity.
If this space was previously created as a spatial anchor, pname:uuid must:
be equal to the slink:XrEventDataSpatialAnchorCreateCompleteFB::pname:uuid
in the event corresponding to the creation of that space.
Subsequent calls to flink:xrGetSpaceUuidFB using the same slink:XrSpace
must: return the same slink:XrUuidEXT.

* pname:componentTypeCapacityInput is the capacity of the
  pname:componentTypes array, or 0 to indicate a request to retrieve the
  required capacity.
* pname:componentTypeCountOutput is a pointer to the count of
  pname:componentTypes written, or a pointer to the required capacity in the
  case that pname:componentTypeCapacityInput is insufficient.
* pname:componentTypes is a pointer to an array of
  elink:XrSpaceComponentTypeFB values, but can: be code:NULL if
  pname:componentTypeCapacityInput is `0`.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:componentTypes size.
****

Lists any component types that an entity supports.
The list of component types available for an entity depends on which
extensions are enabled.
Component types must: not be enumerated unless the corresponding extension
that defines them is also enabled.

  asynchronous request.
****

Enables or disables the specified component for the specified entity.
This operation is asynchronous and always returns immediately, regardless of
the value of pname:timeout.
The pname:requestId can: be used to later refer to the request, such as
identifying which request has completed when an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceSetStatusCompleteFB is posted to the event queue.
This function must: return ename:XR_ERROR_SPACE_COMPONENT_NOT_SUPPORTED_FB
