==== Overview

This extension enables applications to locate the individual joints of hand
tracking inputs.
It enables applications to render hands in XR experiences and interact with
virtual objects using hand joints.

==== Inspect system capability

[open,refpage='XrSystemHandTrackingPropertiesEXT',type='structs',desc='System property for hand tracking',xrefs='']
--
An application can: inspect whether the system is capable of hand tracking
input by extending the slink:XrSystemProperties with
slink:XrSystemHandTrackingPropertiesEXT structure when calling
flink:xrGetSystemProperties.

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemHandTrackingPropertiesEXT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:supportsHandTracking is an basetype:XrBool32, indicating if current
  system is capable of hand tracking input.
****

include::{generated}/validity/structs/XrSystemHandTrackingPropertiesEXT.txt[]

If a runtime returns ename:XR_FALSE for pname:supportsHandTracking, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateHandTrackerEXT.

==== Create a hand tracker handle

[open,refpage='XrHandTrackerEXT',type='handles',desc='Represents a tracker for a hand joints.']
--
The slink:XrHandTrackerEXT handle represents the resources for hand tracking
of the specific hand.

include::{generated}/api/handles/XrHandTrackerEXT.txt[]

An application creates separate slink:XrHandTrackerEXT handles for left and
right hands.
This handle can be used to locate hand joints using
flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT function.

A hand tracker provides joint locations with an unobstructed range of motion
of an empty human hand.

[NOTE]
.Note

  pname:jointLocations array.
* pname:jointLocations is an array of slink:XrHandJointLocationEXT receiving
  the returned hand joint locations.
****

The application must: allocate the memory for the output array
pname:jointLocations that can contain at least pname:jointCount of
slink:XrHandJointLocationEXT.

The application must: set pname:jointCount as described by the
elink:XrHandJointSetEXT when creating the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT otherwise
the runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The runtime must: return pname:jointLocations representing the range of
motion of a human hand, without any obstructions.
Input systems that obstruct the movement of the user's hand (e.g.: a held
controller preventing the user from making a fist) or that have only limited
ability to track finger positions must: use the information available to
them to emulate an unobstructed range of motion.

The runtime must: update the pname:jointLocations array ordered so that the
application can index elements using the corresponding hand joint enum (e.g.
elink:XrHandJointEXT) as described by elink:XrHandJointSetEXT when creating
the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT.
For example, when the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT is created with
ename:XR_HAND_JOINT_SET_DEFAULT_EXT, the application must: set the
pname:jointCount to dlink:XR_HAND_JOINT_COUNT_EXT, and the runtime must:
fill the pname:jointLocations array ordered so that it may be indexed by the
elink:XrHandJointEXT enum.

If the returned pname:isActive is true, the runtime must: return all joint
locations with both ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT and
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_VALID_BIT set.
Although, in this case, some joint space locations may: be untracked (i.e.
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_TRACKED_BIT or
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_TRACKED_BIT is unset).

If the returned pname:isActive is false, it indicates the hand tracker did
not detect the hand input or the application lost input focus.
In this case, the runtime must: return all pname:jointLocations with neither
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT nor
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_VALID_BIT set.

slink:XrHandJointLocationEXT structure describes the position, orientation,
and radius of a hand joint.

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrHandJointLocationEXT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:locationFlags is a bitfield, with bit masks defined in
  elink:XrSpaceLocationFlagBits, to indicate which members contain valid
  data.
  If none of the bits are set, no other fields in this structure should: be
  considered to be valid or meaningful.
* pname:pose is an slink:XrPosef defining the position and orientation of
  the origin of a hand joint within the reference frame of the corresponding
  slink:XrHandJointsLocateInfoEXT::pname:baseSpace.
* pname:radius is a code:float value radius of the corresponding joint in
  units of meters.
****

If the returned pname:locationFlags has
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT set, the returned radius must: be
a positive value.

If the returned pname:locationFlags has
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT unset, the returned radius value
is undefined and should be avoided.

The application can chain an slink:XrHandJointVelocitiesEXT structure to the
pname:next pointer of slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT when calling
flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT to retrieve the hand joint velocities.

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrHandJointVelocitiesEXT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:jointCount is a code:uint32_t describing the number of elements in
  pname:jointVelocities array.
* pname:jointVelocities is an array of slink:XrHandJointVelocityEXT
  receiving the returned hand joint velocities.
****

The application must: allocate the memory for the output array
pname:jointVelocities that can contain at least pname:jointCount of
slink:XrHandJointVelocityEXT.

The application must: input pname:jointCount as described by the
elink:XrHandJointSetEXT when creating the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT.
Otherwise, the runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The runtime must: update the pname:jointVelocities array in the order so
that the application can index elements using the corresponding hand joint
enum (e.g. elink:XrHandJointEXT) as described by the elink:XrHandJointSetEXT
when creating the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT.
For example, when the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT is created with
ename:XR_HAND_JOINT_SET_DEFAULT_EXT, the application must: set the
pname:jointCount to dlink:XR_HAND_JOINT_COUNT_EXT, and the returned
pname:jointVelocities array must: be ordered to be indexed by enum
elink:XrHandJointEXT enum.

If the returned slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT::pname:isActive is false, it
indicates the hand tracker did not detect a hand input or the application
lost input focus.
In this case, the runtime must: return all pname:jointVelocities with
neither ename:XR_SPACE_VELOCITY_LINEAR_VALID_BIT nor
ename:XR_SPACE_VELOCITY_ANGULAR_VALID_BIT set.

If an slink:XrHandJointVelocitiesEXT structure is chained to
slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT::pname:next, the returned
slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT::pname:isActive is true, and the velocity is
observed or can be calculated by the runtime, the runtime must: fill in the
linear velocity of each hand joint within the reference frame of
pname:baseSpace and set the ename:XR_SPACE_VELOCITY_LINEAR_VALID_BIT.
Similarly, if an slink:XrHandJointVelocitiesEXT structure is chained to
slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT::pname:next, the returned
slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT::pname:isActive is true, and the __angular
velocity__ is observed or can be calculated by the runtime, the runtime
must: fill in the angular velocity of each joint within the reference frame
of pname:baseSpace and set the ename:XR_SPACE_VELOCITY_ANGULAR_VALID_BIT.

  parallel to the rotational axis of the hand joint.
  The vector's magnitude is the relative angular speed of the hand joint in
  radians per second.
  The vector follows the right-hand rule for torque/rotation.

==== Conventions of hand joints

This extension defines 26 joints for hand tracking: 4 joints for the thumb
finger, 5 joints for the other four fingers, and the wrist and palm of the
hands.

image::images/ext_hand_tracking_joint_convention.png["Convention of hand joints",width=1600]

[open,refpage='XrHandJointEXT',type='enums',desc='The name of hand joints that can be tracked',xrefs='']
--
include::{generated}/api/enums/XrHandJointEXT.txt[]
--

The finger joints, except the tips, are named after the corresponding bone
at the further end of the bone from the finger tips.
The joint's orientation is defined at a fully opened hand pose facing down
as in the above picture.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Many applications and game engines use names to identify joints rather than
using indices.
If possible, applications should use the joint name part of the
elink:XrHandJointEXT enum plus a hand identifier to help prevent joint name
clashes (e.g. Index_Metacarpal_L, Thumb_Tip_R).
Using consistent names increases the portability of assets between
applications and engines.
Including the hand in the identifier prevents ambiguity when both hands are
used in the same skeleton, such as when they are combined with additional
joints to form a full body skeleton.
====

The backward (+Z) direction is parallel to the corresponding bone and points
away from the finger tip.
The up (+Y) direction is pointing out of the back of and perpendicular to
the corresponding finger nail at the fully opened hand pose.
The X direction is perpendicular to Y and Z and follows the right hand rule.

The wrist joint is located at the pivot point of the wrist which is location
invariant when twisting hand without moving the forearm.
The backward (+Z) direction is parallel to the line from wrist joint to
middle finger metacarpal joint, and points away from the finger tips.
The up (+Y) direction points out towards back of hand and perpendicular to
the skin at wrist.
The X direction is perpendicular to the Y and Z directions and follows the
right hand rule.

The palm joint is located at the center of the middle finger's metacarpal
bone.
The backward (+Z) direction is parallel to the middle finger's metacarpal
bone, and points away from the finger tips.
The up (+Y) direction is perpendicular to palm surface and pointing towards
the back of the hand.
The X direction is perpendicular to the Y and Z directions and follows the
right hand rule.

The radius of each joint is the distance from the joint to the skin in
meters.
The application can use a sphere at the joint location with joint radius for
collision detection for interactions, such as pushing a virtual button using
the index finger tip.

For example, suppose the radius of the palm joint is `r` then the app can:
offset `{0, -r, 0}` to palm joint location to get the surface of hand palm
center, or offset `{0, r, 0}` to get the back surface of the hand.

Note that the palm joint for the hand tracking is not the same as
subpathname:/input/grip/pose when hand tracking is provided by controller
tracking.
A "grip" pose is located at the center of the controller handle when user is
holding a controller, outside of the user's hand.
A "palm" pose is located at the center of middle finger metacarpal bone
which is inside the user's hand.
