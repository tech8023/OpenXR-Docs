*Overview*

This extension defines a new "standard pose identifier" for interaction
profiles, named "palm_ext".
The new identifier is a pose that can be used to place application-specific
visual content such as avatar visuals that may or may not match human hands.
This extension also adds a new input component path using this "palm_ext"
pose identifier to existing interaction profiles when active.

The application can: use the subpathname:/input/palm_ext/pose component path
to place visual content representing the user's physical hand location.
Application visuals may depict, for example, realistic human hands that are
very simply animated or creative depictions such as an animal, an alien, or
robot limb extremity.

Note that this is not intended to be an alternative to extensions that
perform hand tracking for more complex use cases: the use of "palm" in the
name is to reflect that it is a user-focused pose rather than a
held-object-focused pose.

*Pose Identifier*

When this extension is active, a runtime must: behave as if the following
were added to the list of <<semantic-path-standard-pose-identifiers>>.

* palm_ext - a pose that allows applications to reliably anchor visual
  content relative to the user's physical hand, whether the user's hand is
  tracked directly or its position and orientation is inferred by a physical
  controller.
  The palm pose is defined as follows:

** The palm position: The user's physical palm centroid, at the surface of
   the palm.
** The palm orientation's +X axis: When a user is holding the controller and
   straightens their index finger, the ray that is normal to the user's palm
   (away from the palm in the left hand, into the palm in the right hand).
** The palm orientation's -Z axis: When a user is holding the controller and
   straightens their index finger, the ray that is parallel to their
   finger's pointing direction.
** The palm orientation's +Y axis: orthogonal to +Z and +X using the
   right-hand rule.

This pose is explicitly static for rigid controller type devices.

*Interaction Profile Additions*

When this extension is active, a runtime must: accept the
subpathname:/input/palm_ext/pose component path for all interaction profiles
that are valid for at least one of the user paths listed below listed below,
including those interaction profiles enabled through extensions.
Actions bound to such palm input component paths must: behave as though
those paths were listed in the original definition of an interaction
profile.

Valid for the user paths

* pathname:/user/hand/left
* pathname:/user/hand/right

Supported component paths:

* On both user paths
** subpathname:/input/palm_ext/pose

[NOTE]
.Note
****
While this extension itself does not add the
subpathname:/input/palm_ext/pose input component path to interaction
profiles defined in extensions, extension authors may: update existing
extensions to add this path, or submit new extensions defining new
interaction profiles using this pose identifier and component path.
For consistency, it is recommended that the subpathname:/input/palm_ext/pose
path in extension-defined interaction profiles be specified as only valid
when this `<<XR_EXT_palm_pose>>` extension is also enabled.

This extension does pose a challenge to API layer implementers attempting to
provide interaction profile support through their layer.
If a runtime implements `<<XR_EXT_palm_pose>>`, and an application enables
it, but such an API layer is unaware of it, the runtime may "accept" (not
error) the additional suggested binding but the layer will not know to
provide data or indicate an active binding.
This behavior, while unexpected, does not violate the specification, and
does not substantially increase the difficulty of providing additional input
support using an API layer.
