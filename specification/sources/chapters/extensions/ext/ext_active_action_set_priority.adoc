*Overview*

The properties of an slink:XrActionSet become immutable after it has been
attached to a session.
This currently includes the priority of the action set preventing the
application from changing the priority number for the duration of the
session.

Given that most runtimes do not actually require this number to be immutable
this extension adds the ability to provide a different priority number for
every slink:XrActiveActionSet provided to flink:xrSyncActions.

When updating the action state with flink:xrSyncActions, the application
can: provide a pointer to an slink:XrActiveActionSetPrioritiesEXT structure
in the pname:next chain of slink:XrActionsSyncInfo.
This structure contains an array of slink:XrActiveActionSetPriorityEXT
structures mapping active action sets to their priority numbers.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_ACTIVE_ACTION_SET_PRIORITIES_EXT

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The slink:XrActiveActionSetPrioritiesEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrActiveActionSetPrioritiesEXT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:countActionSetPriorities is an integer specifying the number of
  valid elements in the actionSetPriorities array.
* pname:actionSetPriorities is a pointer to an array that maps action sets
  to their active priority numbers.
  If an action set is specified multiple times, the runtime may: return
  ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE from flink:xrSyncActions.
****

include::{generated}/validity/structs/XrActiveActionSetPrioritiesEXT.txt[]

The runtime must: ignore any priority numbers for action sets that were not
specified as an active action set in the slink:XrActionsSyncInfo structure
as this would have no effect.

The priority numbers provided in slink:XrActiveActionSetPriorityEXT must:
override the priority number of the active action set starting with the
flink:xrSyncActions call it is provided to, until the first subsequent call
to flink:xrSyncActions.

When a subsequent call is made to flink:xrSyncActions where an active action
set does not have a corresponding priority number specified in the
slink:XrActiveActionSetPriorityEXT structure the priority number for that
action set must: revert back to the priority number provided in
slink:XrActionSetCreateInfo when that action set was created.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:actionSet is the handle of the slink:XrActionSet to set the priority
  number for.
* pname:priorityOverride is an integer specifying the priority of the action
  set while it is active.

*New Functions*

*Issues*

* Can the same action set have a different priority on each subaction path?
** No.
   To avoid additional complexity each action set can only be specified once
   in the array of priorities which does not include the subaction path.

*Version History*

* Revision 1, 2022-08-19 (Jules Blok)
** Initial proposal.
