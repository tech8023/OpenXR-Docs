*Overview*

This extension augments the `<<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>>` extension to enable
applications to request that the slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT returned by
flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT should return hand joint locations conforming to
a range of motion specified by the application.

The application must: enable the `<<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>>` extension in
order to use this extension.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

The elink:XrHandJointsMotionRangeEXT describes the hand joints' range of
motion returned by flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT.

Runtimes must: support both
ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_CONFORMING_TO_CONTROLLER_EXT and
ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_UNOBSTRUCTED_EXT for each controller
interaction profile that supports hand joint data.

.Enumerant Descriptions
****
* ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_UNOBSTRUCTED_EXT This option refers to
  the range of motion of a human hand, without any obstructions.
  Input systems that obstruct the movement of the user's hand (e.g.: a held
  controller preventing the user from making a fist) or have only limited
  ability to track finger positions must: use the information available to
  them to emulate an unobstructed range of motion.

* ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_CONFORMING_TO_CONTROLLER_EXT This option
  refers to the range of motion of the hand joints taking into account any
  physical limits imposed by the controller itself.
  This will tend to be the most accurate pose compared to the user's actual
  hand pose, but might not allow a closed fist for example.

** If the current interaction profile represents a controller, or other
   device that obstructs the hand, the implementation must: return joint
   locations conforming to the shape of that device.
   If the current interaction profile is being emulated by a different
   physical controller, the implementation may: return joint locations
   conforming to the shape of either the current interaction profile or the
   actual physical controller.

** If the current interaction profile does not represent a controller, the
   implementation must: return joint locations based on the unobstructed
   joint locations.

*New Structures*

--
The slink:XrHandJointsMotionRangeInfoEXT is a structure that an application
can: chain in slink:XrHandJointsLocateInfoEXT to request the joint motion
range specified by the pname:handJointsMotionRange field.

Runtimes must: return the appropriate joint locations depending on the
pname:handJointsMotionRange field and the currently active interaction
profile.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:handJointsMotionRange is an elink:XrHandJointsMotionRangeEXT that
  defines the hand joint range of motion the application wants.
