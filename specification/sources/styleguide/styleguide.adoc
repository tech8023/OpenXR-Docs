[[introduction]]
= Introduction

This document contains required procedures and conventions when writing
specifications for new OpenXR APIs, extensions and layers, or related
Khronos documentation such as white papers and tutorials; or contributing to
existing OpenXR specifications.
These are collectively referred to as _OpenXR Documentation_ or just
_documentation_ below.
The primary focus is the API Specification and API extensions, although all
of the markup and most of the writing style is equally applicable to other
documentation.

It should be noted that the _OpenXR Documentation_ has been branched from
the Vulkan documentation.
A deliberate decision was made to keep the API standards similar, although
this may diverge over time as changes are made to either standard.
The OpenXR version of this style guide is also influenced by _Etna_, the
proposal that was adopted as a starting point for the OpenXR specification.

The primary purpose is to achieve consistency across the API, as well as
across all of our source and output documents.
Consistency makes it easier for developers, editors, reviewers, and users of
our documentation to understand and modify it.

This document has been ratified by the OpenXR working group.

This means that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the procedures and
conventions must be followed when making changes or additions to the OpenXR
specification.
If you have a strong desire to modify the procedures and conventions, such
changes must be made through the normal OpenXR Working group process.

[[introduction-terminology]]
== Terminology

The key words *must*, *required*, *should*, *recommend*, *may*, and
*optional* in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

[[introduction-structure]]
== Document Structure

The style guide is broken into four sections:

* <<naming,API Naming Conventions>> - the required rules for choosing names
  of OpenXR identifiers of all types.
* <<extensions,Extensions and Layers>> - the required procedures for
  creating formal OpenXR extensions and layers.
* <<markup,Markup Style>> - the required and recommended markup style for
  writing asciidoc and XML source that follows consistent formatting and
  layout guidelines, tags special terms and phrases for proper processing by
  the spec generation tools, etc.
* <<writing,Writing Style>> - the required and recommended writing style for
  overall and fine-grained structure and conventions, normative language
  use, API naming conventions, common words and phrases to use and to avoid,
  linking and cross-referencing, etc.


[[introduction-asciidoc]]
== Asciidoc Markup

OpenXR Documentation is primarily written in Asciidoc, a form of text markup
language.
Specifically we're using the version of Asciidoc that is actively maintained
by asciidoctor, which is documented on its website at
http://www.asciidoctor.org/.

References to the Asciidoctor User Manual are to sections in the document at
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/.

Asciidoctor is implemented in Ruby (https://www.ruby-lang.org/), which is
available for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows.
Multiple preview tools also exist for the language, primarily using
AsciidoctorJ (https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj) or asciidoctor.js
(https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js).
In particular, GitHub and GitLab both have asciidoc previews for `.adoc` or
`.asciidoc` files in repositories, and live preview extensions exist for
Chrome and Firefox.

The Asciidoctor toolchain and build process are not addressed by this
document, which concentrates solely on source documents.

[[introduction-normative]]
== Normative References

Normative references are references to external documents or resources to
which documentation authors must comply.

= Still To Be Done

* Image formats.
* Include definitions.
* Something about verb tenses in the writing chapter.
* Something about the use of abbreviations and acronyms.

// Appendices are included below
// Omitted for now because we have no explicit VUID added.
// include::vuid.adoc[]
