The diagram for this extension was initially composed in
[SolveSpace](http://solvespace.com) using version 3.0.
The `.slvs` file is that document.

It was then exported to a PDF file and imported into Inkscape,
where it was modified and had labels added to it.
This final Inkscape SVG file is what is incorporated into the specification.
